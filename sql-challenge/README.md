 # Employee Database Analysis

This project focuses on designing and analyzing a relational database for managing employee information. Below is a summary of the work completed.

## **Contents**
1. ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) - [Included as an image]
2. Table Schemas - `Table_Schemata.sql`
3. SQL Queries - `Queries.sql`

## **Project Overview**
The challenge involved:
- Designing a relational database schema based on the provided data.
- Importing data from CSV files into PostgreSQL.
- Writing SQL queries to analyze the data.

## **Instructions**
### **ERD**
An image of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is included in the repository as `ERD.png`.

### **SQL Files**
- `table_schemata.sql`: Contains SQL statements to create the database schema.
- `queries.sql`: Contains (8) SQL queries for data analysis.

## **Tools Used**
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- QuickDBD for ERD
- dbdiagram.io for additional diagramming

## **How to Use**
1. Run the `table_schemata.sql` file in your PostgreSQL environment to create the database.
2. Import the CSV data into the corresponding tables.
3. Run the queries from `queries.sql` for data analysis.

## **Results**
Key insights from the analysis include:
- Listing employees in various departments.
- Identifying department managers.
- Finding employees hired in specific years.
